## Introduction

Only a new app framework can define a new operating system.

Per a HybridOS app, because it can run on device side and client side,
the app framework should be platform independent.

Generally, a HybridOS app consists of zero, or more activities,
and zero, or more request responders. But a HybridOS app
at least consists of one activity or one request responder.

An activity shows a rendered content page to the end user, the user
interacts with the app to complete some tasks.

A request responder executes a request and feeds the result data to
various system services or requests from network and other HybridOS apps.

The app framework should hide the details of the different runtime
platforms. For example, on a platform that supports multiple processes,
a request responder of an HybridOS App may run in a
separate process on that platform, but on a platform that supports
only multithreading, the request responder may run in a thread.

Moreover, the app framework needs to provide a consistent API for
different app running environments, such as device-side, client-side,
and simulator, thus greatly reducing the cost of development.

The app framework should also hide the details of the different application
protocols, so the app can use one request responder to serve a request
in different protocols, for example, HTTP, CoAP, or MQTT.

In order to achieve the above goals, we use data bus as an infrastructure,
which interchanges the data between different activities and services
in JSON format, and use URI to determine the identity of a resource,
regardless it is located in other thread of the same process,
other process, other device, other client, or other remote server.

### GUI Programming Model

A new app framework defines a new operating system, while the
new app framework first needs a new GUI programming model.

In GUI programming model, the event-driven programming
model has gained popularity. Event-driven programming is structured
around the concept of decoupled relationships between event producers
and event consumers.

Currently, almost all mature GUI support systems are event driven.
In order to facilitate development, these GUI support systems, including
Gtk+, Qt, MiniGUI, Windows, Android, iOS basically adopt concepts
such as Toolkit, Widget, or Control. The developer puts various
widgets on a window or an activity, and manipulates the widgets or
handles the events generated by them.

However, the traditional widget-based programming mechanism does not
provide a good solution for decoupling data and rendering relationships.

On the other hand, the development of Web technologies,
especially the development of HTML5 and CSS 3, makes webpages
more interactive, and provides a simple, easy to use and flexible
coding and implementation mechanism, especially on decoupling
the data and rendering relationships.

The designers of HybridOS believe that the client GUI programming
mechanism should learn from Web technologies. Furthermore, we
believe that the many benefits of web client programming are not
derived from the JavaScript language, but rather the underlying
structured document description mechanism (DOM) and the CSS-based
style definition mechanism.

Therefore, HybridOS's GUI programming model no longer adheres to
the traditional Toolkit/Widget mechanism; we choose to extend HTML5 and
introduce the support of CSS 3. When programming is required, HybridOS
provides the JavaScript programming interface same as Web browser
for high-end device configurations and a C++ programming interface for
low-end device configurations.

The key features follow:

1. The developer always use HVML (HybridOS View Markup Language, which
   defines a few new tags based on HTML 5.3) and CSS 3 to define
   the structure, styles, and layout of the elements and GUI.

1. The user agent of HVML ('HybridOS App Engine', `HAE` for short) will
   have two profiles. One ships with a JavaScript engine (V8) and the
   other without the JavaScript engine. If the device hardware has enough
   computing power (at lease 64MB RAM and 600MHz CPU),
   the developer can write the device apps in JavaScript language by using
   the high profile of HAE. Or, the developer falls back to write the
   device apps in C++ language by using the low profile of HAE.

1. HAE will be cross-platform, one device app written in JavaScript
   can run on any operating system (Linux/Windows/macOS/Android/iOS)
   directly.

We think that this is a universal solution for the GUI programming framework,
and never be out of date.

## Window, Activity, and Intent

The concept of `activity` and `intent` is almost the same ones like
other platform, such as Android.

In HybridOS, a window in HybridOS will keep active/visible constantly
on the screen, while one activity is a special window instance which
can be hung up, and there is only one active/visible activity in the
whole system.

Whether it is a window or an activity, it renders and shows HVML documents.
Generally, a window or an activity can be created by the desktop or from
the following HTML code:

```html
    <a href="foo/bar.hvml" target="_blank">Link</a>

    <form action="foo/bar.hvml" target="_blank">
      First name: <input type="text" name="fname" /><br />
      Last name: <input type="text" name="lname" /><br />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
```

Per a HVML document, we may get a dynamic HVML content by sending
a request to the HTTP server with different parameters. In HybridOS,
the dynamic content of an activity is obtained by using the intent,
the external separate data source, and the new tags introduced by
[HybridOS View Markup Language]. This is a feature introduced by HVML
to support dynamic content locally.

When you launch an activity, you can pass the intent as the GET
parameters to the HVML document:

    foot/bar.hvml?fname=XXX&lname=XXX

Or pass the intent as a JSON object to the HVML document.

HAE will use the intent data to get JSON data from a data source,
and the HVML parser will generate some new HVML elements
by using the JSON data. Indeed, the HVML document acts as a template
under this situation.

When the user submits a form in an activity, HybridOS will pass the
data in JSON format to the next HVML page as the intent. In this way,
a HybridOS app will run like a web app without the HTTP server.

Note that HybridOS also provides the traditional way to fetch a HVML
file from a remote HTTP server. In this situation, the data will be
included in the HVML file.

## Desktop

In HybridOS, there will be a task running as the
desktop of the system. It manages the windows, activities, including
the system windows such as launcher, screen lock, status bar,
notification page, and control center (imagining a smart phone).

In HybridOS, the desktop is a special HAE, it launches the windows and
activities and shows the rendered content of the activities in `view`
elements of a virtual HVML document, which represents the layout of
all active and/or historical activities in the system.

As described in [HybridOS View Markup Language],
we can design a special `view` type, which renders screens in an activity
in a separate process if the underlying kernel supports multi-process.

Therefore, the desktop and the activities (the almost same for windows)
can interact each other in the following way:

- The desktop uses a `hiview` element to represent an activity
  in the system.
- The HVML engine creates a shared frame buffer for a `view` element,
  and launches the app in a separate process.
- The activity attaches to the shared frame buffer and renders content
  of HVML documents to the frame buffer.
- The desktop copies the rendered content from the shared frame buffer
  to the rendered HVML page of the desktop.
- The desktop collects the input events from the device drivers and
  passes the input events to the app process via pipe or socket.
- The desktop listens for requests from the activities and responds
  appropriately, e.g., launching a new activities with the intent data.

Obviously, the desktop acts the role like [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/)
of Linux desktop system. However, we can manage the activities
by using the Web technologies (as well as the extensions introduced by HVML):

- We can use HVML and CSS to define the layout of activities and windows.
- We can use animation and transition of CSS to define the special effects
  to launch an activity, close an activity, and switch between activities.
- We can easily manage the activities and windows by writing some JavaScript code.
- We run the app (also activities and windows) in separate processes and even in
  sandboxes to get the best security.
- ...

Obviously, we can also render an activity or a window which are described in
HVML and CSS by using HAE. That is, multiple HAE instances `run` in a bigger
HAE instance (desktop). The HAE for desktop and activities/windows differ
only in the two ways:

- The HAE for desktop renders content to screen, and the HAE for activities
  renders content to the shared frame buffer.
- The former gets the input events from the hardware directly, and the latter
  gets the input events from the desktop.

It is essential that, in our HybridOS app framework, we can render an activity
or a window in a native graphics app, for example, a MiniGUI app or a OpenGL ES
app written in C/C++ language.

For example, the virtual HVML document of the desktop will look like
as follows if there is a running calculator activity:

```html
<hvml>
<head>
    ...
</head>

<body>
    <hiview type="window" design="default"
            class="screenlock" id="screenlock"
            width="768" height="1024">
        <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system" />
        <param name="entry" value="screenlock" />
    </hiview>

    <hiview type="window" design="default"
            class="statusbar" id="statusbar"
            width="768" height="24">
        <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system" />
        <param name="entry" value="statusbar" />
    </hiview>

    <hiview type="window" design="default"
            class="notification" id="notification"
            width="768" height="1024">
        <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system" />
        <param name="entry" value="notification" />
    </hiview>

    <ul class="activities normal">
        <li class="active">
            <hiview type="activity" design="default"
                    class="active" id="act1234"
                    width="768" height="1024">
                <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.calculator" />
                <param name="entry" value="" />
            </hiview>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <hiview type="window" design="default"
            class="launcher" id="launcher"
            width="768" height="1024">
        <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system" />
        <param name="entry" value="launcher" />
    </hiview>

    <hiview type="window" design="default"
            class="background" id="background"
            width="768" height="1024">
        <param name="app" value="cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system" />
        <param name="entry" value="background" />
    </hiview>

</body>
</hvml>
```

## Service

The goal of a service of one HybridOS app is providing data for other
components of HybridOS.

As described in [HybridOS Architecture], one HybridOS app can register
a request handler at a specific endpoint. When there is a request
on this endpoint which comes from HybridOS HTTP, MQTT, or CoAP servers,
the server forwards the request to this app via hiBus, the app handles
the request and returns the response data to the server.

For example, a HTTP request may be sent to the device:

    http://foo/bar/values/temp

Here `foo` is the host name of the HybridOS device, `bar` is the
app name, while `values` is the endpoint registered by the app.

The HTTP server running in HybridOS will get the request. It translate
and dispatch the request in JSON format to `bar` app via hiBus.
The `bar` app handles the request and returns the response data in
JSON format. After get the response data returned by `bar` app, the
HTTP server convert the response data in JSON to a HTML document
and send the reply content to the remote.

On a traditional OS, the request handlers commonly are implemented
by centralized Python scripts. On HybridOS, the request handlers will
be implemented by individual HybridOS apps.

### Request Responder

The implementation of a service is called `a request responder`.
Generally, a request responder will be implemented in a separate
executable of an app. The hiBus daemon launches the executable
as a separate process if it is not running (the daemon should
make sure there is only one instance), and feed the request data
to the process. The process handle the request and send the response
data to hiBus daemon, the daemon then transfers the response data
to the caller.

### Representation of Response Data

For different protocols, the response data may need to be represented
in different forms. For example, a HTTP request may expect to get
a HTML document instead of a raw JSON data.

Therefore, the HybridOS app framework should provide a way to convert
the response data in JSON to a specific representation form.

We can use the dynamic content generation technology introduced by
HVML. By using HVML, the HTTP server can easily generate a dynamic HTML
document by using a HVML document (a template) and the JSON data.

Therefore, the response data may contain a field to indicate the template
document for HTML or other content types.

## App

### App Sandbox

On device, except for the system daemons, servers, and the desktop,
all apps will run in Linux sandbox when the kernel is Linux.

For more information, please refer to [HybridOS Security Design].

The system will extract the App package under `/app/<app-name>/`, and
prepare the directories for sandbox. The following tree gives the
layout of the sandbox for the app `cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system`:

```
app/
└── cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system
    ├── bin
    ├── dev
    ├── etc
    ├── hae
    │   ├── activity
    │   │   └── settings
    │   │       └── index.hvml
    │   ├── asset
    │   │   ├── default.css
    │   │   └── default.js
    │   ├── main.js
    │   ├── manifest.json
    │   ├── service
    │   │   ├── bar.js
    │   │   └── foo.js
    │   └── window
    │       ├── controlcenter
    │       │   └── index.hvml
    │       ├── index.hvml
    │       ├── launcher
    │       │   └── index.hvml
    │       ├── notification
    │       │   └── index.hvml
    │       ├── screenlock
    │       │   └── index.hvml
    │       └── statusbar
    │           └── index.hvml
    ├── lib
    ├── usr
    └── var
        ├── data
        │   └── settings.db
        └── run
            ├── hibus.sock
            └── hiwebkit-view.sock
```

For example, we refer to the control center activity by using the following URI:

    /app/cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system/activity/controlcenter[/index.hvml]

and refer to the foo service by using the following URI:

    /app/cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system/service/foo

When

### App Service

After an app was started, it will register some endpoints to serve
the requests from remote devices. The system server will build a
map between the external URIs and internals URI like follows,

- registered endpoint: `/desktop/foo`
   * external URI: `<host>/desktop/foo`
   * internal URI: `/app/cn.fmsoft.hybridos.desktop/service/foo`
- registered endpoint: `/system/log`
   * external URI: `<host>/system/log`
   * internal URI: `/app/cn.fmsoft.hybridos.system/service/log`

Note that, all internal requests should be sent and served via hiBus in JSON format.

HAE will provide a global `app` object and some extended JavaScript objects,
in order that the app developer can write some JavaScript code in `main.js` to:

- connect to hiBus and register services for the external endpoints.
- connect to other global remote services via MQTT or WebSocket.
- response to the requests from hiBus, or generate events to the whole system.
- read or write data from/to the local files.
- launch the default activity.

### App Package

Like Android, an app will be packaged in gzip format with
the public key and the digital signature signed by the private key.

### App Permissions

To be continued.

## Data Exchange

### Interacting with System Daemons

One HybridOS apps can interact with the system daemons by using [hiBus]
in two ways:

1. Listen to system events. For example, the changes of WiFi signal
strength.
1. Send a commend to a system daemon synchronously or asynchronously.
For example, connect to a WiFi hotspot.

For security, one HybridOS app which want to listen or talk to a
specific system daemon needs to get an access token from the security
daemon first. If the app does not have the corresponding permission,
or the access token is expired, the daemon will deny the access.

The access token are bound to the signature of a HybridOS app.
For more information, please refer to [HybridOS Security Design].

### Interacting with App Services

One HybridOS apps can interact with any service of other app by
using [hiBus] in two ways:

1. Listen to customized app events.
1. Send a commend to an app service synchronously or asynchronously.

However, unlike system daemons, an app service only runs on demand.
The system will start an app service only if there is a request to it,
and will kill the app service when there is no request to it
for a particular time since last response.

## Infrastructure

### hiBus

hiBus provides a secure data bus mechanism for communication between
different modules of the system. One HybridOS app can send commands to
the specified system daemons or a service of a particular app via hiBus.

One HybridOS app can listen for certain types of events, and the
underlying daemon sends events to the app via hiBus.

For more information, please refer to [hiBus].

### hiWebKit

[hiWebKit], a WebKit derivative, provides support for
[HybridOS View Markup Language], as well as the popular Web standards
and specifications such as HTML 5.x and CSS 3.

hiWebKit provides a set C++ APIs to manipulate DOM tree and CSS
properties for HybridOS app. It is the alternative of JavaScript for
low profile.

hiWebKit also provides a set of C-based APIs to develop the built-in
view renderers. The developer can use the APIs to render view elements
by using the internal graphics functions of hiWebKit.

### HAE

HAE (HybridOS app engine) is the real executable image to run any
HybridOS app.

It also provides some extended JavaScript objects for activity/service/listener
management, connectivity (support for hiBus, MQTT, and/or WebSocket),
and so on.

## Tools

### Simulator

For a long time, the development of an embedded or IoT apps is
basically a loop of the following steps:

1. Write code on the host;
2. Cross compilation on the host;
3. Transfer the image to the development board;
4. Run the program on the development board;
5. If encountered any problem, go to the first step.

Through high-level abstraction, HybridOS isolates apps, servers, and
the underlying details of system. As a result, most of the debugging work
can be done on the host. Not only that, HybridOS's device emulation environment
can also simulate the underlying communication protocols such as mobile/wireless
networks (NB-Iot, 4G/LTE, Bluetooth, WiFi) and other peripherals.
This will greatly reduce the development complexity of HybrdiOS apps and help
the developers focus on business code rather than system code.

For more information, please refer to [HybridOS Device Simulation Environment].

## Deprecated

### Assets

For a HybridOS app running in a device, most of resource assets of it
should be stored locally, either on file system or embedded into the
program image.

You can use the URL scheme `file` to locate an asset, for example,
an image, which is stored on file system. However, HybridOS provides
more flexibility to support assets which are embedded in the
program image. We call this type of asset as `in-core` resource.

For such assets, a HybridOS app can still use `file` to refer to
them. But the app don't have to worry about whether the asset comes
from a local file system or is data embedded in the program image.

In HybridOS, HVML files, image files, media files, GNU gettext
`mo` files are all assets of a HybridOS app.

### HFCL

HFCL ([HybridOS Foundation Class Library]) provides a set C++ APIs to
manipulate DOM tree and CSS properties for HybridOS app. It is the
alternative of JavaScript for low profile.

### desktop.js

hybrid.js provides APIs for the desktop of HybridOS to launch activities,
like the window manager for HybridOS.

For more information, please refer to [hybrid.js].
